# About me

I am currently a Severo Ochoa Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas (ICMAT, Madrid).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate in geometric group theory at the University of Oxford, working in [Dawid Kielak's](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/) team.

Even more previously, I was at the University of Warwick where I completed my PhD under the supervision of [Saul Schleimer](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgar/).
