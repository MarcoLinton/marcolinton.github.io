## Research interests:
My general research revolves around low-dimensional groups. I am particularly interested in one-relator groups, free-by-cyclic groups and graphs of groups. Within these classes I mainly think about hyperbolicity, coherence, the conjugacy problem and the efficiency of the word problem.

## Articles:
1) The theory of one-relator groups: history and recent progress, (with [Carl-Fredrik Nyberg-Brodda](https://sites.google.com/view/cf-nb/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18306)).
   
2) Lifting relations in right orderable groups, ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17057)).

3) Residually rationally solvable one-relator groups, ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09272)).

4) Group rings of three-manifold groups (with [Dawid Kielak](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/kielak/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15907), Published in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.](https://doi.org/10.1090/proc/16716)).
