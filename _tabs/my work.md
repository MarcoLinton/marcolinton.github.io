## Research interests:
My general research revolves around low-dimensional groups. I am particularly interested in one-relator groups, free-by-cyclic groups and graphs of groups. Within these classes I mainly think about hyperbolicity, coherence, the conjugacy problem and the efficiency of the word problem.

## Preprints: 

1) The geometry of subgroups of mapping tori of free groups, ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03145)).
   
2) Pullbacks and intersections in categories of graphs of groups, (with [Jordi Delgado](https://jdrmaths.wixsite.com/jdelgado), [Jone Lopez de Gamiz Zearra](https://sites.google.com/view/joneldg/inicio), [Mallika Roy](https://sites.google.com/view/mallika-roy/home), [Pascal Weil](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~pascal.weil/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04362)).

3) The theory of one-relator groups: history and recent progress, (with [Carl-Fredrik Nyberg-Brodda](https://sites.google.com/view/cf-nb/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18306)).
   
4) Lifting relations in right orderable groups, ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17057)).

5) On the intersections of finitely generated subgroups of free groups: reduced rank to full rank ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10814)).
