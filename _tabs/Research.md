## Research interests:
My general research revolves around low-dimensional groups. I am particularly interested in one-relator groups, free-by-cyclic groups and graphs of groups. Within these classes I mainly think about (relative) hyperbolicity, (relative) quasi-conexity, coherence, the finitely generated intersection property and certain algorithmic problems.
